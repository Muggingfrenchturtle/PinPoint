PinPoint : cool name, kinda boring app.

**Windows key + ] toggles between bordered and borderless mode**

(probably) allows more precision by making shot rhythm (probably) easier to hone.

Also (probably) makes flipper shots more measurable rather than purely muscle memory/feeling.

Allows more specific documentation of shot locations than just a vague "center of flipper but a bit late-ish". 
You can now say "flipper center, 5 clicks, 53."

now, of course, muscle memory and honing skills via actually playing and getting a feel of things is always better than depending on some rough program. 

also this program dosent help in on the fly shots at all, and there are plenty of times in plenty of machines where you *have* to do on the fly shots, and cradling just isnt an option. (see disclaimer)

but maaaaybe this can sorta help out in increasing your accuracy of shots from a cradle. maybe. 

i apologize to the more competent devs out there who *might* be planning to make a (better) pinball aiming apllication, for taking the (very cool) name "pinpoint".
if someone decides to release such a program (but better), i am very willing to change the name of this app and give *you* the name. cuz ngl i feel guilty giving this app such a (very cool) name.

(DISCLAIMER : Currently limited to only cradle/trap shots. on-the-fly shots is uh, idk how to make something like this work on those without literally connecting the app to the virtual pinball game and detecting if the ball is touching the flipper)

i might update the app in the future if i feel like it
